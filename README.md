** IF YOU SEE CHANGES, USE git merge origin/main **

### Cloning
- For getting the repo to your local machine
- Here, you can make changes/modify files locally before committing or pushing these to the repo
- What you do is go to our repo here under the 'code' tab (if you're reading this, you're porbably there already)
- You should see a green button '<> Code', click it
- You will see three tabs, for simplicity, select SSH (you can use HTTPS if you prefer, I've only used SSH before)
- Copy the link
- Go into your home (not root)  directory in terminal (should be there as soon as you open it, if not, use cd ~)
- Now, use the following command: git clone git@github.com:howdopointerswork/Project-2413.git
- It should create a directory in your home folder called Project-2413
- Go into it by using cd Project-2413
- You now now have access to the repo locally
